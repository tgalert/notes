What if the Telegram monitoring system would be executed completely manually by a analogous clerk:

(Simplified system: one set of patterns that applies to all channels and groups, only one strategy for checking for pattern matches).

We need the following:

- List with channels and groups
- List with patterns to look out for
- An email address to notify when a pattern matches
- We are logged in to Telegram with a Telegram account (phone number)

Operations (directives to the clerk):

- Add channel or group to the list
- Remove channel or group from the list
- Add pattern to the list
- Remove pattern from the list
- Change email address to notify
- Change Telegram account (log out from current account and log in with new account)
