Replace the default guest/guest administrator user with a new administrator user that has a safe password.

1. Create new administrator user
- Similar to creating an ordinary user, but you have to set the `adminstrator` tag:
  - PUT /api/users/name
  - Basic authentication: guest:guest
  - Body: `{"password":"secret","tags":"administrator"}`
- Only users with the `administrator` tag can manage (create/delete) other users, vhosts, and permissions
- If you attempt to create/delete a user/vhost/permission with a user without the `administrator` tag, the response is `401 Unauthorized`
- The user that you use to create a vhost automatically gets access to this vhost
2. Delete the default guest/guest user
- DELETE /api/users/guest
- Basic authentication: admin:secret
- Body: none
